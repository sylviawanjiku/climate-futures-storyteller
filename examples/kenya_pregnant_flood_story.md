# Flooded Paths, Open Hearts

*A climate futures story set in kenya, 2027*

The rain started three days ago, and now Carlos watches the water rise around their home, knowing that today's antenatal appointment might be impossible to reach.

Back in 2015, things were different. Carlos remembers when life was simpler. The rhythm of daily life was predictable, comfortable, taken for granted.

But change came gradually, then suddenly. Carlos noticed the small things first - the small changes that added up. Then the big changes started happening faster than anyone expected.

Now, in 2030, Carlos faces new realities every day. Carlos faces new challenges every day.

But Carlos has learned to adapt. Carlos has found new ways to thrive.

The community has come together in ways Carlos never expected. The community has found strength in working together.

As Carlos looks out at the changed landscape, there's a mix of loss and hope. The world is different now, but the human spirit of adaptation and community resilience shines through. The challenges have brought out the best in people, creating new possibilities for the future.

The sensory details are everywhere: The sound of rushing water, the smell of mud and debris, the sight of familiar paths transformed into rivers

Daily life has transformed: Alternative routes to work, elevated storage, emergency supplies always ready

For Carlos, this journey has been deeply personal. discovered she was pregnant just as the climate impacts became more severe, and now Carlos is part of a community learning to thrive in a changing world.

The cultural context of kenya adds another layer to this story. Strong community bonds, traditional birth attendants, extended family support systems, matatu transport challenges, and this heritage provides both challenges and strengths as the community adapts to new realities.

This story reflects the reality of climate change as we understand it in 2025: 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels, with increasing frequency of floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and accelerating with regional variations. The impacts are real, but so is the human capacity for adaptation and resilience.

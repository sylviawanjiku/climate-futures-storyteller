# The Invisible Threat

*A climate futures story set in kenya, 2031*

The mosquitoes are worse this year, and Michael feels their constant buzz as a threat to the life growing inside her, knowing that malaria during pregnancy can be devastating.

Back in 2020, things were different. Michael remembers when life was simpler. The rhythm of daily life was predictable, comfortable, taken for granted.

But change came gradually, then suddenly. Michael noticed the small things first - the small changes that added up. Then the big changes started happening faster than anyone expected.

Now, in 2030, Michael faces new realities every day. Michael faces new challenges every day.

But Michael has learned to adapt. Michael has found new ways to thrive.

The community has come together in ways Michael never expected. The community has found strength in working together.

As Michael looks out at the changed landscape, there's a mix of loss and hope. The world is different now, but the human spirit of adaptation and community resilience shines through. The challenges have brought out the best in people, creating new possibilities for the future.

The sensory details are everywhere: The constant buzz of mosquitoes, the smell of standing water, the sight of nets and repellents everywhere

Daily life has transformed: Mosquito nets, repellent application, avoiding standing water, different outdoor activities

For Michael, this journey has been deeply personal. had her first child during a drought, now expecting her second during floods, and now Michael is part of a community learning to thrive in a changing world.

The cultural context of kenya adds another layer to this story. Strong community bonds, traditional birth attendants, extended family support systems, matatu transport challenges, and this heritage provides both challenges and strengths as the community adapts to new realities.

This story reflects the reality of climate change as we understand it in 2025: 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels, with increasing frequency of floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and accelerating with regional variations. The impacts are real, but so is the human capacity for adaptation and resilience.

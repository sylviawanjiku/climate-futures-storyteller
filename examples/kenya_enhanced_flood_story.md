# The Water Between Us

*A climate futures story set in kenya, 2042*

The rain started three days ago, and now Maria watches the water rise around their home, knowing that today's antenatal appointment might be impossible to reach.

Back in 2036, things were different. Maria remembers when life was simpler. The rhythm of daily life was predictable, comfortable, taken for granted.

But change came gradually, then suddenly. Maria noticed the small things first - the small changes that added up. Then the big changes started happening faster than anyone expected.

Now, in 2030, Maria faces new realities every day. The roads to the clinic are impassable again, and Maria worries about missing critical antenatal appointments. The floodwaters have cut off access to healthcare when it's needed most.

But Maria has learned to adapt. The community has established emergency transport systems and mobile clinics that can reach flooded areas. Maria has learned to identify safe routes and alternative healthcare options when the main roads are impassable.

The community has come together in ways Maria never expected. The community has found strength in working together.

As Maria looks out at the changed landscape, there's a mix of loss and hope. The world is different now, but the human spirit of adaptation and community resilience shines through. The challenges have brought out the best in people, creating new possibilities for the future.

The sensory details are everywhere: The sound of rushing water, the smell of mud and debris, the sight of familiar paths transformed into rivers

Daily life has transformed: Alternative routes to work, elevated storage, emergency supplies always ready

For Maria, this journey has been deeply personal. had her first child during a drought, now expecting her second during floods, and now Maria is part of a community learning to thrive in a changing world.

The cultural context of kenya adds another layer to this story. Strong community bonds, traditional birth attendants, extended family support systems, matatu transport challenges, and this heritage provides both challenges and strengths as the community adapts to new realities.

This story reflects the reality of climate change as we understand it in 2025: 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels, with increasing frequency of floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and accelerating with regional variations. The impacts are real, but so is the human capacity for adaptation and resilience.

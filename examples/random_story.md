# When the Mountains Burned

*A climate futures story set in himalayas, 2027*

The sky is orange again today. Lakshmi has learned to read the color of the horizon like a weather forecast, and this particular shade means another day of staying inside, windows closed against the smoke.

Back in 2012, things were different. Lakshmi remembers when life was simpler. The rhythm of daily life was predictable, comfortable, taken for granted.

But change came gradually, then suddenly. Lakshmi noticed the small things first - the fire season starting earlier each year, the smoke becoming a regular visitor. Then the big changes started happening faster than anyone expected.

Now, in 2030, Lakshmi faces new realities every day. Every summer, Lakshmi keeps a bag packed by the door. The evacuation orders come with little warning, and the smoke makes it hard to breathe even when the flames are miles away.

But Lakshmi has learned to adapt. The property has been cleared of flammable materials, and Lakshmi has learned to read the wind and weather patterns. The community has established early warning systems and evacuation plans.

The community has come together in ways Lakshmi never expected. The community has formed fire watch groups, established evacuation protocols, and created support networks for those who have lost homes.

As Lakshmi looks out at the changed landscape, there's a mix of loss and hope. The world is different now, but the human spirit of adaptation and community resilience shines through. The fires have taught the community to respect the power of nature while building stronger bonds and more resilient communities.

The sensory details are everywhere: The acrid smell of smoke, the orange glow of distant flames, the ash that falls like snow

Daily life has transformed: Evacuation bags always ready, different outdoor activities, new insurance concerns

For Lakshmi, this journey has been deeply personal. born and raised in the neighborhood, seeing it transform, and now Lakshmi is part of a community learning to thrive in a changing world.

The cultural context of himalayas adds another layer to this story. Sacred mountain traditions, water as life source, community interdependence, and this heritage provides both challenges and strengths as the community adapts to new realities.

This story reflects the reality of climate change as we understand it in 2025: 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels, with increasing frequency of floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and accelerating with regional variations. The impacts are real, but so is the human capacity for adaptation and resilience.

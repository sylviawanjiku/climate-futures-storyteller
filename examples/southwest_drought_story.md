# The Thirsty Season

*A climate futures story set in southwestern_usa, 2030*

The sound of water is different now. Fatima remembers when the river used to rush past their window, but today it's just a trickle, and the silence is deafening.

Back in 2017, things were different. Fatima remembers when life was simpler. The rhythm of daily life was predictable, comfortable, taken for granted.

But change came gradually, then suddenly. Fatima noticed the small things first - the wells running dry earlier each year, the crops needing more water than before. Then the big changes started happening faster than anyone expected.

Now, in 2030, Fatima faces new realities every day. Fatima has learned to measure water in drops, not gallons. The garden that once fed the family now struggles to survive, and the community well runs dry by mid-summer.

But Fatima has learned to adapt. Fatima has become a master of water conservation, collecting every drop of rainwater and growing drought-resistant crops. The community shares resources and knowledge about sustainable farming.

The community has come together in ways Fatima never expected. The community has established water-sharing agreements, created community gardens, and organized workshops on sustainable living.

As Fatima looks out at the changed landscape, there's a mix of loss and hope. The world is different now, but the human spirit of adaptation and community resilience shines through. The scarcity of water has taught the community to value every resource, creating a more sustainable way of life that honors the land and each other.

The sensory details are everywhere: The crack of parched earth, the weight of water restrictions, the dust that seems to coat everything

Daily life has transformed: Shorter showers, brown lawns, different shopping patterns, new ways of growing food

For Fatima, this journey has been deeply personal. grew up in the countryside, now teaching others about adaptation, and now Fatima is part of a community learning to thrive in a changing world.

The cultural context of southwestern_usa adds another layer to this story. Water rights history, desert adaptation traditions, growing urban populations, and this heritage provides both challenges and strengths as the community adapts to new realities.

This story reflects the reality of climate change as we understand it in 2025: 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels, with increasing frequency of floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and accelerating with regional variations. The impacts are real, but so is the human capacity for adaptation and resilience.

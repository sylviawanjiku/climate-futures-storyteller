# When the Air Burned

*A climate futures story set in nairobi, 2043*

At 6 AM, the air already feels like a warm blanket. Fatima steps outside and immediately feels the weight of the day ahead, knowing that by noon, the streets will be empty and the city will retreat indoors.

Back in 2033, things were different. Fatima remembers when life was simpler. The rhythm of daily life was predictable, comfortable, taken for granted.

But change came gradually, then suddenly. Fatima noticed the small things first - the summer days getting longer and hotter, the nights offering less relief. Then the big changes started happening faster than anyone expected.

Now, in 2030, Fatima faces new realities every day. The heat has reshaped Fatima's entire day. Work starts at dawn and ends by noon, and the afternoons are spent in whatever cool place can be found.

But Fatima has learned to adapt. The home has been retrofitted with better insulation and cooling systems that run on renewable energy. Fatima has learned to work with the heat, not against it.

The community has come together in ways Fatima never expected. Cooling centers have been set up in community buildings, and neighbors check on each other during heat waves, especially the elderly and vulnerable.

As Fatima looks out at the changed landscape, there's a mix of loss and hope. The world is different now, but the human spirit of adaptation and community resilience shines through. The heat has forced innovation and adaptation, leading to new technologies and community practices that are more resilient and sustainable.

The sensory details are everywhere: The oppressive weight of air that feels like a blanket, the relief of shade, the constant hum of cooling systems

Daily life has transformed: Shifted work hours, indoor activities, different clothing choices, new social patterns

For Fatima, this journey has been deeply personal. became a mother in a time of climate uncertainty, adapting daily to new challenges, and now Fatima is part of a community learning to thrive in a changing world.

The cultural context of nairobi adds another layer to this story. Urban migration, informal economy, strong community networks, matatu culture, and this heritage provides both challenges and strengths as the community adapts to new realities.

This story reflects the reality of climate change as we understand it in 2025: 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels, with increasing frequency of floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and accelerating with regional variations. The impacts are real, but so is the human capacity for adaptation and resilience.

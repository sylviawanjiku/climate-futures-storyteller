# Climate Futures Storyteller

An AI-powered storytelling system that creates compelling, realistic narratives about how climate change is transforming daily life around the world. The system generates 1000-1500 word stories that help readers connect emotionally with climate change beyond abstract statistics.

## Features

- **Realistic Climate Scenarios**: Stories set between present day and 2050 based on latest climate science
- **Regional Specificity**: Tailored climate impacts for different regions and communities
- **Diverse Characters**: Protagonists from various backgrounds, ages, and socioeconomic statuses
- **Balanced Narratives**: Stories that balance challenges with human adaptations and solutions
- **Sensory Details**: First-person perspectives with tangible climate impact descriptions

## Climate Science Base (as of October 2025)

- Global temperatures trending toward 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels
- Increasing frequency of extreme weather events (floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires)
- Rising sea levels affecting coastal communities
- Shifting agricultural zones and growing seasons
- Biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption

## Usage

```python
from climate_storyteller import ClimateStoryteller

# Initialize the storyteller
storyteller = ClimateStoryteller()

# Generate a story for a specific location and climate impact
story = storyteller.generate_story(
    location="Miami, Florida",
    climate_impact="sea_level_rise",
    character_focus="coastal_community"
)

print(story)
```
